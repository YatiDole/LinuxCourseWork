1. Based on the movie's tone and rhetoric - why do you think there was an anti-Microsoft tone at the time of the movies making (~2001)? (You may need to research [Microsoft anti-trust case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp. "Anti-Trust") ).
* Based on the movie's tone Microsoft was the main provider of software and programs, under a Unix operating system. The majority of software would work but one had to figure out how to make it work with his or her system. Microsoft had a copyright which made the software unable to public.This not only makes program problematic ,the only ones who can make changes were the creators.	
1. When Bill Gates wrote his 1976 *"Open Letter to Hobbyists"*, was he justified in his complaint?  Why or why not?
* When Bill Gates wrote his 1976 "Open Letter to Hobbyists", he basically wanted users to stop illegally copying and distributing software hence the term copyright. He can be justifed to an extent to the fact that the deed of copying itself back then was considered illegal. But comparing his work of developing to musician's shows the monopoly microsoft claimed . According to me software development should be free in a way giving back to the community and allowing everybody to contribute towards making a better product.

1. According to Eric S. Raymond what was the major application that needed to "flip" for opensource to become a viable enterprise solution?
